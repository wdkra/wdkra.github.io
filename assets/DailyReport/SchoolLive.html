    <p>My middle school is nflsxc. It’s also my primary school. And I have studied here for 9 years. I think it’s a good school. Almost all teachers in middle school are good. There 
        are many plants in the campus. It’s very beautiful when toward evening. There’re several festivals in this school. E.g. Art Festival, Sport Festival. As far as I know, these 
        festivals are highly rated by most parents and students. But I hardly take part in these festivals. Because I’m neither good at Art nor sport. To be honest, the main reason I 
        like this school is that the student here was not much pressured on by school. They have lots of time to develop their hobbies. There’s not a lot of homework in this school. 
        If u write them quickly, u will have a lot of time to do some other things. That’s y I like this school.

    <p>I was in class 12 in middle school. The head teacher is fjh.  He teaches Chinese. He is a kind, patient and gentle teacher，and also a teacher who is very short. (photos) He 
        often tells  jokes when we are sleepy in the class. The classmates are interestring. They are all good at telling jokes. By the way, all the photos used here haven’t got the 
        agreement of their owners.
